# password-based-circuit-breaker
The password based circuit breaker is a security system designed to control the supply of electricity using a digital password. It works with the 8051 microcontroller, a keypad, and a LCD display. The keypad lets the user enter the password, which if correct displays a message and activates the mechanism to switch ON the electrical load.
